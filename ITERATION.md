* ###Part 3 (due 10/13)
[10 points]

>1. Create lo-fi mockups and storyboards corresponding to at least 4 user stories.
>2. Put the initial stories on Pivotal Tracker. We strongly encourage that you make a public Tracker. Make sure that your GSI has been added to your Pivotal Tracker project so that he/she can view it. If your customer is tech-savvy, consider adding them to the Tracker account. The more engaged your customer, the more smoothly the agile process will go!
>3. Create a 2-minute video interview with your customer describing the problem you will be solving and the application you will be building. For students with customers outside of the Bay Area, please submit an online video chat capture with your customer. One piece of software you may use for this is http://www.screenleap.com/. An example of an interview video (you may need to ask different questions because this video was made after the end of the project): http://vimeo.com/46770083
>4. Submit your deliverables to Piazza in a private post tagged #iteration0-3 and #11. Make sure you submit a link to your Pivotal Tracker. Remember to add your GSI to your Tracker if it is private. For the lo-fi mockups and storyboard sketches, scan them and attach them as images to your post. For the video, if the size is beyond Piazzaâ€™s limit, please submit it via some file sharing website such as the UC Berkeley Box service: https://berkeley.box.com/login
