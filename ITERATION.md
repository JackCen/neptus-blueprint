**Write a 2-paragraph (max) summary of the main customer need and how the app meets it, including who the stakeholders are.** Please submit the summary and stories on Piazza in a post tagged #iteration0-2 and #11. You may either submit photos of your index cards or type them up.
Create at least **4** user stories on index cards. These should be in the Connextra format:
```
Feature: Add a movie to Rotten Potatoes
  As a movie fan
  So that I can share a movie with other movie fans
I want to add a movie to Rotten Potatoes database
```
```
Summary:
According to our client, the basic functionality should resemble Ninja Courses, a popular class scheduling website.
Our website should simplifiy class scheduling by automatically checking every possible combination of classes for a schedule, 
and then organizing them based on certain criterias. So our application should have two distinct parts. 
One of it should be class schedule collection. 
The app needs to be able to fetch all of class scheduling information from a university's official website.
In addition to that, the app needs to have an interal data structure to store user data 
so that each user has his or her own class schedule. 
```
```
Feature 1: Add class schedule fethcing function to Neptus Blueprint
  So that we can provide class information to the user
```
```
Feature 2: Add scheduling function to Neptus Blueprint
  So that the user can add and remove classes to change the schedule.
```
```
Feature 3: Add auto scheduling function to Neptus Blueprint
  So that the app can generate a draft to let the user choose. 
```
```
Feature 4: Add class search function to Neptus Blueprint
  So that the user can search for courses based on certain criterias. 
```

>1. Create lo-fi mockups and storyboards corresponding to at least 4 user stories.
>2. Put the initial stories on Pivotal Tracker. We strongly encourage that you make a public Tracker. Make sure that your GSI has been added to your Pivotal Tracker project so that he/she can view it. If your customer is tech-savvy, consider adding them to the Tracker account. The more engaged your customer, the more smoothly the agile process will go!
>3. Create a 2-minute video interview with your customer describing the problem you will be solving and the application you will be building. For students with customers outside of the Bay Area, please submit an online video chat capture with your customer. One piece of software you may use for this is http://www.screenleap.com/. An example of an interview video (you may need to ask different questions because this video was made after the end of the project): http://vimeo.com/46770083
>4. Submit your deliverables to Piazza in a private post tagged #iteration0-3 and #11. Make sure you submit a link to your Pivotal Tracker. Remember to add your GSI to your Tracker if it is private. For the lo-fi mockups and storyboard sketches, scan them and attach them as images to your post. For the video, if the size is beyond Piazzaâ€™s limit, please submit it via some file sharing website such as the UC Berkeley Box service: https://berkeley.box.com/login
