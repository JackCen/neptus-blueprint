Neptus Blueprint
================

##Project Purpose

Neptus is a non-profit, that seeks to spread as a student organization to universities around the world. Our Mission is to help non-profits Analyze Data to better Assess Impact. With our strong focus on Universities and students, we seek to build a solution to facilitate the process of getting into top universities, help students select major(s), classes, decals, frats, sororities, student groups, internships, and also bridge the gap between jobs and studies - so that employers can better assess who has spent their time on college productively, and so that high performing students from top universities can more readily get a job in the field they want to work in. At Cal, there are many solutions that help you pick classes once you already know what and how many majors you will take. But those who need to find themselves and their passion are underserved. Myself, I had a passion for computer science when I started my first degree in 1999. The problem is that by the time I finished in 2002, the work market was horrible. Nearly impossible to find a job. I had friend who had to write more than 100 applications before they got a job. Luckily, I had instead decided to continue studying for another degree in marketing, since I wanted to become an entrepreneur. A tool like this would prepare me long in advance that the job market had a downward trend, and that more students should seriously consider studying more. Neptus seek to become a recommendation engine for college students, suggesting which classes and major(s) you should take - considering what kind of job(s) you are looking to get.



##Specifics

We want to collect a lot of data about class descriptions, friends academic activities, job descriptions, macro economic trends, work environment preferences, trends in technology development, and put them into a graph database much like www.GraphMyLife.net - to accurately understand current conditions, and based on time series developments being able to postulate trends with some degree of certainty. As a non-profit, we seek to have an open and transparent approach to collecting and analysing data, adopting open innovation methodologies, featuring an API and allowing others to contribute in how data is being visualized and graphically presented. We've already developed relationships with various non-profits like ACLU, YMCA, which would be able to provide us with data for other types of analysis. Neptus has a long term goal of focusing on sustainability, and will therefore have a particular focus on climate change, global warming and developing various scenarios for nature disasters and water rising due to glaciers melting. But first we need to collect the data, structure the data, and apply both machine learning methods and a multi-factor model approach to analysing the data. Methods I'm quite familiar with already teaching the class Quantitative Trading: www.DeCal.org/Quant This project builds off a projects I was involved with in 2011, called Education 360: www.j.mp/Education360 which focus on analytics for elementary schools. I recently got a book from www.Neo4j.org called "Graph Databases", and I'll be going to the upcoming conference www.GraphConnect.com to develop a better understanding of graph databases.
